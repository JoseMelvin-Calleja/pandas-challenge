# pandas-challenge

This project is for UPenn Data Science Bootcamp Module 4 Challenge. 

In this project, there is a notebook, 'PyCitySchools_start.ipynb', that collects school and student data to perform an analysis on the school district. The notebook finds the average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing. We find these same metrics multiple times with different group definitions. This project provides insights on what kinds of schools perform well.
